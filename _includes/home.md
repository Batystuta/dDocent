**dDocent** is simple bash wrapper to QC, assemble, map, and call SNPs from almost any kind of RAD sequencing.  If you have a reference already, dDocent can be used to call SNPs from almost any type of NGS data set.  It is designed to run on Linux based machines with large memory capacity and multiple processing cores, and it can be modified for use on HPC.  

**In Defense of Science**

We are deeply concerned by the Trump administration's move to gag 
scientists working at various governmental agencies. The US government 
employs scientists working on medicine, public health, agriculture, 
energy, space, clean water and air, weather, the climate and many other 
important areas. Their job is to produce data to inform decisions by 
policymakers, businesses and individuals. We are all best served by 
allowing these scientists to discuss their findings openly and without 
the intrusion of politics. Any attack on their ability to do so is 
an attack on our ability to make informed decisions as individuals, 
as communities and as a nation. 

If you are a government scientist who is blocked from discussing their 
work, we will share it on your behalf, publicly or with the appropriate 
recipients. You can email us at USScienceFacts@gmail.com.
