#Welcome to the Tutorial Section

There are two different tutorials.  One works on assembling an optimal reference and the other works on filtering SNP data.

In the eternal words of Baz Luhrman:

> Advice is a form of nostalgia. Dispensing it is a way of fishing the past from the disposal, wiping it off, painting over the ugly parts and recycling it for more than it's worth.

**The guidelines in here are not intended to be a best practices document**
**Do not blindly apply them to your own data.  Take the time to experiment**

In this directory, you will find 4 critical files

1. RefTut
2. FilterTut
3. Filtering Tutorial.md
4. Reference Assembly Tutorial.md

The tutorials can be experienced in two different formats:

1.  Executable text files to be view in the terminal
2.  Github formated .md files to be viewed through github.
